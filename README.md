# RecipeAPI
Recipe API that I created in Flask (Python). Purpose is to create a convenient way to share recipe data, and make it customizable.

I wanted this to exist because reworking recipes for various allergies, substitutions, etc. proved to be tedious.

# Tools Used
- Text Editor: VisualStudio Code
- Terminal: Ubuntu Linux
